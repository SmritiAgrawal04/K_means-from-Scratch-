# K_means-from-Scratch-

Given a dataset of documents with content from 5 different fields ( namely business, entertainment, politics, sport, and tech ), cluster them using K-means.
In the dataset, the number after the ’-’ symbol in the file name denotes the cluster label.


However, in the test dataset you'll not be given with any such class tags as K_means is unsupervised learning- this is done in the class file.
